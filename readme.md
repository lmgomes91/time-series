# Time Series Forecasting with TensorFlow

## Overview
This Python project utilizes TensorFlow for time series forecasting, specifically focusing on predicting Bitcoin values from January 2023. The forecasting is performed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with two different approaches: multivariate and univariate.

## Requirements
 - Python 3.10 or higher
 - TensorFlow
 - Other dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)
